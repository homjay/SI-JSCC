# SI-JSCC: SNR-Independent Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Image Transmission

## Usage

To use SI-JSCC, please follow the steps below:

1. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `SI-JSCC.ipynb` file.
3. To add noise to the encoded file, use the `awgn_channel.m` file located in the test folder.
